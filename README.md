# Fake_News_Detection
Fake News Detection: Developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as either fake or genuine. The model was trained on a labeled dataset using supervised learning techniques to detect patterns in the text. Various preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization were used to clean and structure the data.

Tech stack: Python, Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data visualization, analysis, and model building.

Purpose: To combat the spread of misinformation by providing a reliable system that helps users identify fake news articles with higher accuracy, contributing to informed decision-making and media literacy.
